# brain_tumor_classification
Step-by-step Breakdown
1. Clone the GitHub Repository
git clone https://github.com/hiteshjha2003/brain_tumor_classification.git

What it does:
This command makes a local copy of the GitHub repository on your machine.

Why it’s needed:
It gives you access to all the code, datasets (if included), and project files.

2. Create a Python Virtual Environment

python3 -m venv env

What it does:
Creates a virtual environment named env. This is an isolated space where Python packages can be installed without affecting your global Python installation.

Why it's useful:
Helps avoid conflicts between dependencies required for different projects.

3. Activate the Virtual Environment

source env/bin/activate

What it does:
Activates the virtual environment you just created. Once activated, any Python or pip command will use the isolated environment.

Note for Windows users:
Use this instead:
.\env\Scripts\activate
4. Install Required Python Libraries
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

What it does:
Installs all the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.

Typical libraries included (example):

tensorflow – for building and training the deep learning model

numpy, pandas – for data handling and analysis

matplotlib – for visualizations

opencv-python – for image processing

streamlit – for building the web app frontend

5. Run the Deep Learning Model Script

python3 brain_tumor_model.py

What it does:
This script  trains or loads a brain tumor classification model (CNN or similar). It may:

Preprocess image data

Train the model

Save the model (.h5 or .pkl file) for later use

Checkpoints or outputs:
Look for model artifacts being saved like model.h5 or printed accuracy scores on the console.

6. Launch the Streamlit Web App
streamlit run app.py

What it does:
Launches a web interface for the project using Streamlit.

Functionality you can expect:

Upload an MRI image

View prediction results: e.g., Tumor Detected / No Tumor

View model performance or visual explanations

How to access the app:
Once this command runs, it typically opens in your browser at:

http://localhost:8501
